Mike Wagner: lead dev 
Karina San Roman: investigating security / accessiblity / design and helping shape the element

Thursdays (9/16) Homework: creating element 
Mike worked on VScode to create the button while I (Karina) worked along side him to research the attributes we wanted to include in our element and help come up with different ideas 


Tuesday Class:
What did you learn today that you will apply: We learned that we could do more than just open another website with our button and want to make it do something else.

What are your next steps: To change our button to preform a task on the screen rather than just open a link on a new page. Not sure what that task is yet.

Tuesdays Class (9/28)
Similar things: 
-Both buttons bring the user to a website
-Both buttons utilize the hover function
Different: 
-We had mulitple buttons on the screen while they only had one
-We used more than one icon while they have not 


Approach: 
-Creating a button that is wrapped in a link 

Team meeting:

Karina researched audio files to use for the button and also how to play the audio files when the button is clicked
