Mike Wagner and Karina San Roman

Tuesday Class:
What did you learn today that you will apply: We learned that we could do more than just open another website with our button and want to make it do something else.

What are your next steps: To change our button to preform a task on the screen rather than just open a link on a new page. Not sure what that task is yet.
