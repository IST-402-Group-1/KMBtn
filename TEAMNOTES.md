Mike Wagner: lead dev 
Karina San Roman: investigating security / accessiblity / design and helping shape the element

Thursdays (9/16) Homework: creating element 
Mike worked on VScode to create the button while I (Karina) worked along side him to research the attributes we wanted to include in our element and help come up with different ideas 


Tuesday Class:
What did you learn today that you will apply: We learned that we could do more than just open another website with our button and want to make it do something else.

What are your next steps: To change our button to preform a task on the screen rather than just open a link on a new page. Not sure what that task is yet.
